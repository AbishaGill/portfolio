        Iâ€™m Abisha Gill, a frontend developer with a strong focus on building modern web applications using React.js. I enjoytaking ideas and turning them into interactive, responsive, and visually appealing websites that people actually love to use. Along with React, I also work with WordPress to build websites that are both dynamic and client-friendly. I customize themes, integrate plugins, and even add my own custom code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) when needed to extend functionality. This allows me to deliver projects that combine the ease of WordPress with the flexibility of modern frontend development
